### So what exactly is a QA Manager?
Think of a QA Manager as the Marie Kondo of the software world – they make sure everything sparks joy (and actually works) before it reaches users. They're the quality gatekeepers who lead teams in testing products, establishing quality standards, and making sure releases don't crash and burn like that one Game of Thrones finale.
### Why should anyone care about having a QA Manager?
Real talk: Without a QA Manager, launching a product is like sending a text without proofreading – embarrassing mistakes are bound to happen. Just ask Meta about their AI image generator that had some... interesting interpretations, or Microsoft's ChatGPT integration that went rogue. A good QA Manager prevents these "oops" moments that can cost millions.
